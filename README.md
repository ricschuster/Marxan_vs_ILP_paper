# Marxan vs Integer Linear Progamming Paper

Comparison of simulated annealing (with Marxan) versus integer linear programming (ILP; with the R package `prioritizr`) for solving conservation prioritizaiton problems. For the ILP prioritizations, we use both Gurobi and Symphony, to provide examples of closed- and open-source ILP solvers, respectively.
